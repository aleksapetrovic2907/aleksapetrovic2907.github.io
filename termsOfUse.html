    <div aria-label="Rich Text Editor, main" contenteditable="false">
        <p>By downloading or using the apps, these terms will
            automatically apply to you – you should make sure therefore that you read them carefully before using the
            app. You’re not allowed to copy or modify the apps, any part of the apps, or our trademarks in any way. You’re
            not allowed to attempt to extract the source code of the apps, and you also shouldn’t try to translate the
            apps into other languages or make derivative versions. The apps itself, and all the trademarks, copyright,
            database rights, and other intellectual property rights related to it, still belong to <strong>Aezakmi Team</strong>.</p>
        <p><strong>Aezakmi Team</strong> is committed to ensuring that the apps are as useful and efficient as possible. For that reason,
            we reserve the right to make changes to the apps or to charge for its services, at any time and for any
            reason. We will never charge you for the apps or its services without making it very clear to you exactly
            what you’re paying for.</p>
        <p>The apps store and process personal data that you have provided to us, to provide our
            Service. It’s your responsibility to keep your phone and access to the apps secure. We therefore recommend
            that you do not jailbreak or root your phone, which is the process of removing software restrictions and
            limitations imposed by the official operating system of your device. It could make your phone vulnerable to
            malware/viruses/malicious programs, compromise your phone’s security features and it could mean that the
            apps won’t work properly or at all.</p>
        <p>The apps does use third-party services that declare their Terms and Conditions.</p>
        <p>Link to Terms and Conditions of third-party service providers used by the apps</p>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Google Play Services</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>You should be aware that there are certain things that <strong>Aezakmi Team</strong> will not take responsibility for. Certain
            functions of the apps will require the apps to have an active internet connection. The connection can be Wi-Fi
            or provided by your mobile network provider, but <strong>Aezakmi Team</strong> cannot take responsibility for the app not
            working at full functionality if you don’t have access to Wi-Fi, and you don’t have any of your data
            allowance left.</p>
        <p><br data-cke-filler="true"></p>
        <p>If you’re using the apps outside of an area with Wi-Fi, you should remember that the terms of the agreement
            with your mobile network provider will still apply. As a result, you may be charged by your mobile provider
            for the cost of data for the duration of the connection while accessing the apps, or other third-party
            charges. In using the apps, you’re accepting responsibility for any such charges, including roaming data
            charges if you use the apps outside of your home territory (i.e. region or country) without turning off data
            roaming. If you are not the bill payer for the device on which you’re using the apps, please be aware that we
            assume that you have received permission from the bill payer for using the apps.</p>
        <p>Along the same lines, <strong>Aezakmi Team</strong> cannot always take responsibility for the way you use the apps i.e. You
            need to make sure that your device stays charged – if it runs out of battery and you can’t turn it on to
            avail the Service, <strong>Aezakmi Team</strong> cannot accept responsibility.</p>
        <p>With respect to <strong>Aezakmi Team’s</strong> responsibility for your use of the apps, when you’re using the apps, it’s
            important to bear in mind that although we endeavor to ensure that it is updated and correct at all times,
            we do rely on third parties to provide information to us so that we can make it available to you. Aezakmi
            Team accepts no liability for any loss, direct or indirect, you experience as a result of relying wholly on
            this functionality of the apps.</p>
        <p>At some point, we may wish to update the apps. The apps are currently available on Android &amp; iOS – the
            requirements for the both systems(and for any additional systems we decide to extend the availability of the
            apps to) may change, and you’ll need to download the updates if you want to keep using the apps. Aezakmi Team
            does not promise that it will always update the apps so that it is relevant to you and/or works with the
            Android &amp; iOS version that you have installed on your device. However, you promise to always accept
            updates to the application when offered to you, We may also wish to stop providing the apps, and may
            terminate use of it at any time without giving notice of termination to you. Unless we tell you otherwise,
            upon any termination, (a) the rights and licenses granted to you in these terms will end; (b) you must stop
            using the apps, and (if needed) delete it from your device.</p>
